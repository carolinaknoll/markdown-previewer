This project is part of the Free Code Camp's [Front-end Libraries Projects](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer/), and follows a series of requested user stories. You can [visit the project's website](https://carolinaknoll.github.io/markdown-previewer/) and click 'Run Tests' on the FreeCodeCamp Test Suite on the top left corner to see the below tests pass.

- [x] <strong>User Story #1:</strong> I can see a <code>textarea</code> element with a corresponding <code>id="editor"</code>.   
- [x] <strong>User Story #2:</strong> I can see an element with a corresponding <code>id="preview"</code>.   
- [x] <strong>User Story #3:</strong> When I enter text into the <code>#editor</code> element, the <code>#preview</code> element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.   
- [x] <strong>User Story #4:</strong> When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the <code>#editor</code> element, the text is rendered as HTML in the <code>#preview</code> element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: <a href='https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked' target='_blank'>https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked</a>).   
- [x] <strong>User Story #5:</strong> When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the <code>#editor</code> field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.   
- [x] <strong>User Story #6:</strong> When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the <code>#editor</code> field should be rendered as HTML in the <code>#preview</code> element.   
- [x] <strong>Optional Bonus (you do not need to make this test pass):</strong> My markdown previewer interprets carriage returns and renders them as <code>br</code> (line break) elements.
